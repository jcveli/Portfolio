# Portfolio site
A basic portfolio webiste for myself to use and showcase my projects and social links to cantact me. Created this to also review on building website applications as well as going over basic React concepts such as components. 

## Tech Stack
- HTML & CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Core UI library
- Framer Motion Library 

- Netlify for deployment 



## Lessons Learned
1. Important to keep your files optimized to keep bandwidth usage for receive/transferring to the minimum as possible
   - Had to optimize the video background in the welcome screen from 5 MBs to about ~600 KBs 
   - Project images had to be optimized well and fit the resolution of the project card image container 
     - This greatly reduced the images size, (where I didn't modify the resolution and captured it on my desktop), from around 2.5 MBs to 212 KBs
   - this contributed greatly reducing my transfer size ~7 MB to ~1.5 MB; a **78.57% decrease**

2. Reduce the amount of decleration by using globabl files 
3. Transitions by using Framer Motion
4. Got to know how to design a responsive site by using Flexbox properties and using min/max-width
5. Further practiced using React with passing props, useStates, and components
